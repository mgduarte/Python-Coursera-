# rock, paper , lizard, spock hand game with fingers determining winner.  Plays against computer.  Coursera Python course
# This is the mini project
# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template
# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions
